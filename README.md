# cSimpleShell
A simple shell in C, includes a history command to view and repeat previous commands, and functional piping for commands

Should be run in a Unix/Linux environment (tested using MobaXTerm and GDB Online)
Allows for normal shell operation, in addition to allowing piping of commands using '|'
"History" command allows for previously entered commands to be viewed
"History" commands followed by a valid integer repeats the command at that point in history
